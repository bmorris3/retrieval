Background
++++++++++

In this tutorial, we seek to measure the temperature of an exoplanet atmosphere
via transmission spectroscopy. As a transiting planet passes in front of its
host star, the planet will appear largest at wavelengths where the planet's
atmosphere is opaque. For this toy model, we will include water opacity as the
only absorbing species in the atmosphere.

As in `Fisher & Heng (2018)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481.4698F/abstract>`_, we compute
the apparent radius of the exoplanet as a function of wavelength given by

.. math::

    R = R_0 + H (\gamma + \ln \tau)

where :math:`R_0` is the fiducial radius of the exoplanet, :math:`H` is the
atmospheric scale height, :math:`\gamma` is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and
:math:`\tau` is

.. math::

    \tau = \frac{\kappa_\lambda P_0}{g} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi R_0}{H}}

where :math:`\kappa_\lambda` is the wavelength-dependent opacity, :math:`P_0`
is the reference pressure probed by transmission spectroscopy, and :math:`g` is
the surface gravity. The pressure scale height :math:`H` is

.. math::

    H = \frac{k_B T}{\mu g}

where :math:`k_B` is Boltzmann's constant, :math:`T` is the temperature, and
:math:`\mu` is the mean molecular weight.

We have generated an example transmission spectrum with random normal noise
with :math:`T = 1500` K, and in the following examples we will attempt to
"retrieve" that temperature directly from the spectrum. First we'll solve for
the approximate temperature (without uncertainties) using :math:`\chi^2`
minimization. Then we'll solve for the temperature and its uncertainty assuming
Gaussian uncertainties using a likelihood function and Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC). Finally, we'll use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) without
defining a proper likelihood.


:math:`\chi^2` minimization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First we will access the pre-generated example spectrum contained within the
``retrieval`` module, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    from retrieval import Planet, get_example_spectrum

    import numpy as np
    from scipy.optimize import fmin_l_bfgs_b
    import astropy.units as u

    example_spectrum = get_example_spectrum()

    plt.plot(example_spectrum[:, 0], example_spectrum[:, 1])
    plt.xlabel('Wavelength [$\mu$m]')
    plt.ylabel('Transit Depth')
    plt.show()

.. plot::

    from retrieval import Planet, get_example_spectrum

    import numpy as np
    from scipy.optimize import fmin_l_bfgs_b
    import astropy.units as u

    example_spectrum = get_example_spectrum()

    plt.plot(example_spectrum[:, 0], example_spectrum[:, 1])
    plt.xlabel('Wavelength [$\mu$m]')
    plt.ylabel('Transit Depth')
    plt.show()

The transit depth spectrum spans the near-infrared, where water opacity is
significant, giving rise to the J, H and K bands visible in this transmission
spectrum near 1.2, 1.6, and 2.2 :math:`\mu`m, for example.

Now we create an instance of the `~retrieval.Planet` object, which requires us
to specify the planet's mass, radius, atmospheric pressure and mean molecular
weight:

.. code-block:: python

    planet = Planet(1 * u.M_jup, 1 * u.R_jup, 1e-3 * u.bar, 2.2 * u.u)


With the exoplanet's properties defined, we can now solve for the temperature
in the atmosphere, using the forward model described in the equations above.
We'll define the :math:`\chi^2` by comparing the example transmission spectrum
with instances of the forward model at different temperatures, varying the
temperature until we find good agreement between the model and observations:

.. code-block:: python

    def chi2(p):
        """
        Compute the chi^2 for the model with parameters `p`
        """
        temperature = p[0] * u.K
        return np.sum((example_spectrum[:, 1] -
                       planet.transit_depth(temperature).flux)**2 /
                      example_spectrum[:, 2]**2)

    initp = [1700]  # K

    bestp = fmin_l_bfgs_b(chi2, initp, approx_grad=True,
                          bounds=[[500, 5000]])[0][0]

The resulting best-fit temperature is::

    >>> print(bestp)  # doctest: +SKIP
    1509.4660124465638

which is close to the temperature used to generate the example spectrum, so we
have demonstrated that the forward model is producing a sufficient approximation
to the observed spectrum. It was straightforward in this example above to fit
for the temperature, but it will take a bit more effort to find the uncertainty
on the temperature.

MCMC with a likelihood
++++++++++++++++++++++

One computationally expensive but easy-to-implement technique for measuring the
uncertainty on the fitting parameter is `Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo>`_. MCMC is a
Bayesian technique, and uses some of the concepts straight out of `Bayes'
theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem>`_,

.. math::

    P\left( \theta \vert D \right) = \frac{ \pi\left( \theta \right) ~{\cal L}\left( D \vert \theta \right) }{ {\cal Z} \left( D \right)}.

The prior distribution, denoted by :math:`\pi(\theta)`, represents your prior
beliefs about the fitting parameters :math:`\theta`.

The likelihood function, :math:`{\cal L}( D \vert \theta)`, is the relationship
between the data (:math:`D`), model and measurement noise. The goal of MCMC is
to numerically evaluate the numerator in the equation on the right hand side of
the equation to solve for the posterior distribution
:math:`P\left( \theta \vert D \right)`.

To do so, we must first describe the prior and likelihood, respectively:

.. code-block:: python

    from emcee import EnsembleSampler

    def lnprior(theta):
        """
        Log-prior
        """
        temperature = theta[0]

        if 500 < temperature < 5000:
            return 0
        return -np.inf

    def lnlikelihood(theta):
        """
        Log-likelihood
        """
        temperature = theta[0] * u.K
        model = planet.transit_depth(temperature).flux
        lp = lnprior(theta)
        return lp + -0.5 * np.sum((example_spectrum[:, 1] - model)**2 /
                                   example_spectrum[:, 2]**2)


We've chosen a flat log-prior that expects the temperature to sit between 500
and 5000 K, which might represent our sensible rough estimates for the minimum
and maximum temperature a planet might have given its orbital distance and host
star's spectral type. The log-likelihood we have chosen for this example is
the sum of the log-prior and :math:`-0.5 \chi^2`. This is a natural choice for
the likelihood given Gaussian, uncorrelated uncertainties for the transit depth
measurements.

We can now sample the posterior distribution with MCMC using
`emcee <https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ like so:

.. code-block:: python

    nwalkers = 4
    ndim = 1

    p0 = [[1500 + 10 * np.random.randn()]
          for i in range(nwalkers)]

    with Pool() as pool:
        sampler = EnsembleSampler(nwalkers, ndim, lnlikelihood, pool=pool)
        sampler.run_mcmc(p0, 1000)

    plt.hist(sampler.flatchain)
    plt.xlabel('Temperature [K]')
    plt.show()

.. plot::

    from retrieval import Planet, get_example_spectrum

    import numpy as np
    import astropy.units as u
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    from emcee import EnsembleSampler

    example_spectrum = get_example_spectrum()

    planet = Planet(1 * u.M_jup, 1 * u.R_jup, 1e-3 * u.bar, 2.2 * u.u)


    def lnprior(theta):
        temperature = theta[0]

        if 500 < temperature < 5000:
            return 0
        return -np.inf


    def lnlikelihood(theta):
        temperature = theta[0] * u.K
        model = planet.transit_depth(temperature).flux
        lp = lnprior(theta)
        return lp + -0.5 * np.sum((example_spectrum[:, 1] - model)**2 /
                                   example_spectrum[:, 2]**2)

    nwalkers = 10
    ndim = 1

    p0 = [[1500 + 10 * np.random.randn()]
          for i in range(nwalkers)]

    sampler = EnsembleSampler(nwalkers, ndim, lnlikelihood)
    sampler.run_mcmc(p0, 1000)

    plt.hist(sampler.flatchain)
    plt.xlabel('Temperature [K]')
    plt.show()

The algorithm produces a "chain" of posterior samples for the temperature of the
atmosphere, which we see is roughly Gaussian in shape, yielding a temperature
measurement of :math:`T \approx 1510 \pm 10` K.

ABC without a likelihood
++++++++++++++++++++++++

There can be situations where the likelihood is expensive or difficult to
compute. In these situations, it can be useful to use `approximate Bayesian
computation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_Bayesian_computation>`_,
a technique for estimating posterior distributions without computing a
likelihood.

Let's imagine for a moment that the spectrum we're trying to retrieve has
been observed at very high resolution, with millions or billions of spectral
channels, making the :math:`\chi^2` expensive to compute. In this case, it is
computationally more efficient to compute a *summary statistic* which reduces
the dimensionality of the problem.

We can use domain knowledge to construct a summary statistic that has some
physically sensible meaning. In this tutorial we will use the difference in
transit depth on and off of a water absorption band as a summary
statistic for the ABC technique. In this tutorial, the only free parameter is
the temperature, so varying the temperature will vary the scale height of the
atmosphere, which drives changes in the absorption band depth.

Below, let's plot water's near-infrared transparency feature which we usually
call the H band (orange), and the water absorption band at just-shorter
wavelengths than the H band (green), and the rest of the spectrum (blue).

.. code-block:: python

    on_h_band = np.abs(wavelength - 1.65) < 0.1
    off_h_band = np.abs(wavelength - 1.425) < 0.1

    depth_on = transit_depth[on_h_band].mean()
    depth_off = transit_depth[off_h_band].mean()
    depth_difference_observed = (depth_off - depth_on) / depth_off


.. plot::

    from retrieval import Planet, get_example_spectrum

    import numpy as np
    import astropy.units as u
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    np.random.seed(42)

    example_spectrum = get_example_spectrum()
    wavelength, transit_depth = example_spectrum[:, 0], example_spectrum[:, 1]

    planet = Planet(1 * u.M_jup, 1 * u.R_jup, 1e-3 * u.bar, 2.2 * u.u)

    on_h_band = np.abs(wavelength - 1.65) < 0.1
    off_h_band = np.abs(wavelength - 1.425) < 0.1

    depth_on = transit_depth[on_h_band].mean()
    depth_off = transit_depth[off_h_band].mean()
    depth_difference_observed = (depth_off - depth_on) / depth_off

    plt.plot(wavelength, transit_depth)
    plt.plot(wavelength[on_h_band], transit_depth[on_h_band])
    plt.axhline(depth_on, color='C1', ls='--')
    plt.plot(wavelength[off_h_band], transit_depth[off_h_band])
    plt.axhline(depth_off, color='C2', ls='--')
    plt.xlim([1.25, 1.8])
    plt.xlabel('Wavelength [$\mu$m]')
    plt.ylabel('Transit depth')
    plt.show()

The "band depth," or mean difference in transit depth on and off of this
water absorption feature, is proportional to the temperature of the atmosphere
in this toy model. We can therefore define a "distance" between the observed
spectrum and simulated (forward) models of the spectrum which is simply the
absolute difference between the band depth in the simulated spectrum and the
band depth in the observed spectrum.

.. code-block:: python

    def distance(theta):
        temperature = theta[0] * u.K
        model = planet.transit_depth(temperature).flux
        depth_difference_simulated = abs((model[off_h_band].mean() -
                                          model[on_h_band].mean()) /
                                         model[off_h_band].mean())
        return abs(depth_difference_simulated - depth_difference_observed)

This is a dimensionality reduction step because we're reducing the
entire spectrum to a single number. One must take care to choose a summary
statistic which unambiguously varies with the fitting parameters of interest --
in general it is not possible to prove that your choice of summary statistic
is "sufficient".

Next we construct a simple rejection sampling algorithm, which varies the
temperature by a small amount, and tests the difference in band depth between
the simulated and observed spectra. If the difference is within some *tolerance*
specified by the user, the step is accepted into a chain, or otherwise it is
discarded. We repeat this procedure for three different tolerances to
demonstrate how the variance of the posterior decreases as the tolerance
decreases:

.. code-block:: python

    init_temp = 1500
    n_steps = 1500

    thresholds = [3e-4, 2e-4, 1e-4]

    for threshold in thresholds:
        # Create chains for the distance and temperature
        distance_chain = [distance([init_temp])]
        temperature_chain = [init_temp]

        # Set some indices
        i = 0
        total_steps = 1

        # Until the chain is the correct number of steps...
        while len(temperature_chain) < n_steps:
            # Generate a trial temperature
            total_steps += 1
            trial_temp = temperature_chain[i] + 10 * np.random.randn()

            # Measure the distance between the trial step and observations
            trial_dist = distance([trial_temp])

            # If trial step has distance less than some threshold...
            if trial_dist < threshold:
                # Accept the step, add values to the chain

In the above approximate posterior distributions, the variance of the posterior
decreases as the tolerance :math:`h` decreases. The parameter :math:`h`
represents the trade off between precision in the posterior approximation and
computation time. The posterior distribution approximations should converge
towards the "true" posterior distribution which you might recover with
*non*-approximate Bayesian inference techniques like MCMC.

Taking the most computationally expensive and most accurate posterior
approximation above (green), we estimate the temperature
:math:`T \approx 1515 \pm 15` K, roughly consistent with the expectation
from MCMC above.
